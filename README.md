# IST-Department-Makeover
Use a lib (jQuery) to consume a web service

For this project I had to get information from an existing web service data source (API). I had to create a web presence for
the IST Department. I used 3 jQuery plugins (Accordion, Slick, DataTables and Featherlight)

The API for the services is available at: http://www.ist.rit.edu/api/
